# What is this? ðŸ¤”
This repo contains code, assets, etc. for a Terraria mod made by knoup, guranku, and hopefully a third member soon. 

# What does the mod do?
The mod aims to add the ability to play as a Druid to Terraria. Most importantly, it should make it possible to shapeshift into different animals/creatures with their own, unique abilities.

# What features can I expect?
I dunno, we haven't talked about it very much yet. 

# Roadmap
It's a map with roads. We just don't have one yet.

# For developers
Please go through the following steps to get up to speed on how to develop mods for Terraria (using tModLoader):
1. Complete the steps [here](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/tModLoader-guide-for-developers). 
2. Then just quickly go through [this guide]( https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Modding-Guide).
3. From â†‘ you should be all set with the very basics.
4. Refer to [the tModLoader docs](http://docs.tmodloader.net/docs/stable/annotated.html) for everything else.
5. Maybe more?
