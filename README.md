# What is this? ðŸ¤”
This repo contains code, assets, etc. for a Terraria mod made by knoup, guranku, and hopefully a third member soon. 

# What does the mod do?
The mod aims to add the ability to play as a Druid to Terraria. Most importantly, it should make it possible to shapeshift into different animals/creatures with their own, unique abilities.

# What features can I expect?
I dunno, we haven't talked about it very much yet. 

# Roadmap
It's a map with roads. We just don't have one yet.
